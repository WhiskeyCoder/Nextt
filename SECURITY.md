## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to avoid potential exploitation.

### 2. **Email us directly**


**If you don't have access to the email above, please contact:**
- **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
- **Maintainer**: Contact the project maintainer directly

### 3. **Include the following information**
- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Steps to reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Environment**: Your environment details (OS, Node.js version, etc.)
- **Proof of concept**: If possible, include a proof of concept

### 4. **Response timeline**
- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status update**: Within 7 days
- **Resolution**: As quickly as possible, typically within 30 days

## Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update your Node.js and npm packages
2. **Use environment variables**: Store sensitive data in environment variables
3. **Secure your API keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
4. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
5. **Regular backups**: Keep regular backups of your configuration and data

### For Developers
1. **Input validation**: Always validate and sanitize user input
2. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
3. **HTTPS only**: Use HTTPS for all communications
4. **Dependency scanning**: Regularly scan for vulnerable dependencies
5. **Code review**: Perform security-focused code reviews

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- [ ] Advanced rate limiting

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:
1. **Private reporting**: Security issues are reported privately
2. **Timely response**: We respond to security reports within 48 hours
3. **Coordinated disclosure**: We coordinate with reporters on disclosure timing
4. **Credit acknowledgment**: We acknowledge security researchers in our releases

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as:
- **Patch releases**: For critical security fixes (e.g., 1.0.1)
- **Minor releases**: For security improvements (e.g., 1.1.0)
- **Major releases**: For significant security changes (e.g., 2.0.0)

## Security Contacts

- **GitHub Security**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
- **Maintainer**: Contact project maintainer directly

## Bug Bounty

Currently, we do not offer a formal bug bounty program. However, we do acknowledge security researchers in our releases and documentation.
